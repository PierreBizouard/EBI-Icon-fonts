# EBI-Icon-fonts
The <code>fonts.css</code> stylesheet automatically loads a range of icon fonts that you can use.

Icons are added automatically through CSS using the <code>:before</code> feature in CSS, so they will appear before whatever piece of text you associate them with. To make this association, you need to include particular class and data-icon attributes in the relevant HTML element: e.g. <code>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="icon icon-generic" data-icon="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Travel by plane&lt;/h4&gt;</code>.

For more information see the readme [link coming soon].
